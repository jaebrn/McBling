McBling Speed Texter 3000 was created in April 2023 by Thomas Rompre, Jenna Brown, and Carolie Delisle.
It was created at Concordia University as a part of CART263.

Along with the program, two large-scale flip phones were contructed from 3D printed parts, plexiglass, and foam. Each phone houses a Makey Makey, which registers the number buttons as inputs for this game. Each phone utilizes numbers 0-9, and additionally have buttons to answer and decline calls, all of which are used as inputs in the game. 

Though the game is intended to be controlled by these phones, it can also be played on the keyboard. 
The inputs for Player 1 are as follows:
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 & 0 on the keyboard (not numpad) as substitutions for the phone number keys. 'Enter' replaces the 'answer' button, and 'Backspace' replaces the 'decline' button.
The inputs for Player 2 are as follows:
q,w,e,r,t,y,u,i,o & p on the keyboard as substitutions for the phone number keys. The numbers correlate in the same incremental order as the P1 inputs. 'Space' replaces the 'answer' button, and 'tab' replaces the 'decline' button. 

To begin the game in singleplayer mode, press answer on the P1 controller (or 'Enter'). Press answer on the P2 controller (or 'Space) to begin in multiplayer mode. 
To re-randomize the song, press decline on either controller, or use '4' and '6' as directional keys to go forward or backward through the song list.

The objective of the game is to press the key corresponding to the number onscreen as it's within the hit box, a la Dance Dance Revolution. Type in the numbers on your phone controller or keyboard in time with the visuals. As numbers are hit consecutively, your score multiplier increases; increasing the speed at which your numbers fall, but also giving you additional points per hit. If your timing is perfect, you'll get an additional score boost!
